      also learned about packages, commands and how to use each one of them on
      the Terminal. I also did a cheatsheet where I wrote all the commands we
      learned and we will use in the future, and I practiced each command that I
      learned on the Terminal and fortunatelly I could do everything right and
      memorize most of the commands.
