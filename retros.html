	In todays lesson we learned about Consoles and some main ideas of it.
We also learned about packages, commands and how to use each one of them on
the Terminal. I also did a cheatsheet where I wrote all the commands we learned 
and we will use in the future, and I practiced each command that I learned on the
Terminal and fortunatelly I could do everything right and memorize most of the
commands.
