	<h2>Ryan Fortes de Lima</h2>

<p>In todays lesson we learned about Consoles and some main ideas of it.
	We also learned about packages, commands and how to use each one of them on
	the Terminal. I also did a cheatsheet where I wrote all the commands we learned 
	and we will use in the future, and I practiced each command that I learned on the
	Terminal and fortunatelly I could do everything right and memorize most of the
	commands.
